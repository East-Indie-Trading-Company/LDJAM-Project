  optionA:
    buttonText: You seem passionate. Should be enough to see you through.
    responseText: My parents don't believe I have the aptitude. I must prove their
      notion baseless. If successful, I can raise our family's prestige to uncharted
      heights.
    flagToRaise: 
  optionB:
    buttonText: You're a decent trader. Why not follow that path instead?
    responseText: You may enjoy trekking across the land hawking inventory to anyone
      with a coin to spare, but my ambitions are much loftier. Any fool can man a
      stand. Only an elite few can bend magic to their will.
    flagToRaise: 
  displayLine: Hector seems worried. You should say something.
