# Contributing Guidelines

## Branch Strategy
- `main` = protected, only release builds
- `dev` = integration branch
- `feature/<system>-<name>` = work branches

## Commits
- Prefix commits with system:
  - `[Dialogue] Added typewriter effect`
  - `[Trading] Fixed buy/sell loop`

## Pull Requests
- Always link to Trello/Notion task
- Small PRs (1 feature max)
- Assign at least 1 reviewer
- Must build before merge

## Pre-Jam Rule
No gameplay code or assets before jam starts.
Docs, repo config, and templates only.
